# Redfox
Redfox is a new open-source web browser written in Python using PyQt5 and is still in development. It uses the PyQtWebEngine for rendering and it's currently in the alpha stage but I'm looking forward to moving it to the dev stage by the new year.

## Why is it in the alpha stage?

Well, it's a pretty barebones browser and it looks pretty ugly. Its UI is called Fox UI, and even that's currently in development. You can open new tabs and websites, but that's about it. I look forward to developing it and would love for contributors.

## Dependencies:

### 1. PyQt5
### 2. PyQtWebEngine
